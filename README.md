## About Me
Iâ€™m Enes (pronounced like the letters 'N S'), a passionate musician and IT specialist based in Germany (+ Turkey). Iâ€™m divin' deep into both music and tech, tryin' to make my mark in both worlds.


### ðŸ’» Tech & Automation
I completed my apprenticeship as an IT specialist in system integration. Iâ€™m super into automation and process optimization. Some stuff Iâ€™ve worked on includes:
- Automatic setup and compliance for PCs
- Automatic setup and management system for information screens at my plant

Iâ€™m also gearing up to start a dual study program in Business Informatics while I work as a freelancer in IT support, software/web programming, and automation.
